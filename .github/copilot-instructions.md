# Copilot Instructions for PDS (Portable Deploy Suite)

## Project Overview

**PDS (Portable Deploy Suite)** is a cross-platform automation toolkit designed to streamline software installation and system configuration across Linux, Windows, and macOS environments.

### Platform Coverage

- **Linux**: Comprehensive packaging solution with full automation capabilities
- **Windows**: PowerShell module and script-based deployment system
- **macOS (Darwin)**: Basic setup scripts (currently in early development)

## Core Development Principles

### üéØ Think Before You Code
- **Plan First**: Always understand the problem completely before implementing
- **Justify Every Addition**: Don't add code just to add code - every line must serve a purpose
- **Question Complexity**: If it feels complex, it probably is - find a simpler way

### üèóÔ∏è Architecture Guidelines

#### Modularity
- Each component should have a single, well-defined responsibility
- Components should be independently testable and maintainable
- Avoid monolithic solutions - break down into logical, reusable modules

#### Loose Coupling
- Minimize dependencies between modules
- Use interfaces and abstractions where appropriate
- Components should be easily replaceable without affecting others

#### Focus & Clarity
- Each function/script should have a clear, specific purpose
- Avoid feature creep - stick to the core mission
- Code should be self-documenting through clear naming and structure

### üìã Repository Conventions

**ALWAYS follow existing patterns and conventions in the repository:**

1. **File Structure**: Maintain the established directory hierarchy
2. **Naming Conventions**: Follow the naming patterns already in use
3. **Code Style**: Match the existing code formatting and style
4. **Documentation**: Keep documentation consistent with current format
5. **Platform Organization**: Respect the separation between `bash/`, `pwsh/`, and `darwin/` directories

### üö´ What NOT to Do

- **Don't over-engineer**: Simple, working solutions are preferred over complex, "clever" ones
- **Don't duplicate functionality**: Reuse existing code where possible
- **Don't break existing patterns**: Follow established conventions religiously
- **Don't add unnecessary dependencies**: Keep the tool portable and lightweight
- **Don't create code without purpose**: Every addition must solve a real problem

### ‚úÖ Best Practices

#### Code Quality
- Write self-explanatory code with clear variable and function names
- Add comments only when the "why" isn't obvious from the code
- Test thoroughly across target platforms
- Handle errors gracefully and provide meaningful feedback

#### Maintainability
- Keep functions small and focused
- Use consistent error handling patterns
- Document any platform-specific behaviors or limitations
- Ensure changes are backward compatible when possible

#### Portability
- Consider platform differences from the start
- Test on actual target platforms, not just development environment
- Use platform-appropriate tools and conventions
- Avoid hardcoded paths or platform assumptions

## Development Workflow

1. **Analyze**: Understand the requirement and existing codebase
2. **Plan**: Design the solution keeping modularity and simplicity in mind
3. **Implement**: Write clean, focused code following repository conventions
4. **Test**: Verify functionality across relevant platforms
5. **Document**: Update relevant documentation if needed
6. **Review**: Ensure the solution maintains codebase quality and consistency

## Remember

The goal is to create a **lean, maintainable, and reliable** deployment suite. Every decision should be evaluated against these principles:

- Does this solve a real problem?
- Is this the simplest solution that works?
- Does this follow existing patterns?
- Will this be maintainable in 6 months?
- Does this add unnecessary complexity?

**When in doubt, choose simplicity over cleverness, and consistency over innovation.**
