# PDS Project Name Alternatives

This document explores alternative names for the PDS project, currently known as "Personal Deploy Scripts". All alternatives maintain the "PDS" acronym while better capturing the project's comprehensive nature as a development environment setup toolkit.

## Current Name
- **Personal Deploy Scripts** - The current project name

## Proposed Alternatives

### Development/Deployment Focused
These names emphasize the development setup and deployment automation aspects:

- **Portable Development Setup** - Emphasizes the cross-platform nature and setup purpose
- **Progressive Development Stack** - Suggests building up your environment incrementally  
- **Personal Deployment Suite** - Broader than just scripts, it's a complete solution

### Tool/Environment Focused
These names highlight the project as a comprehensive development environment toolkit:

- **Personal Development Station** - Your workstation setup toolkit
- **Portable Dev Studio** - Emphasis on portability and comprehensive setup
- **Personal DevOps Suite** - Includes the automation/ops aspect

### Action-Oriented
These names focus on what the project actually does:

- **Provision Development Software** - Describes what it actually does
- **Personal Development Scaffolder** - Builds out your dev environment
- **Portable Development Starter** - Gets you up and running quickly

## Analysis

### Why Change from "Personal Deploy Scripts"?
The current name suggests a simple collection of scripts, but the project is actually:
- A comprehensive development environment setup tool
- Cross-platform compatible (Linux, macOS, Windows/WSL)
- Includes CLI helpers and package management
- Provides a complete suite of installation functions
- Offers theme and UI customization tools

### Top Recommendations

1. **Portable Development Setup** - Best captures the cross-platform nature and setup purpose
2. **Personal Development Suite** - Sounds more comprehensive than "scripts"
3. **Provision Development Software** - Clearly describes the action it performs

### Considerations
- **Portable** variants emphasize cross-platform compatibility
- **Suite** variants suggest completeness and integration
- **Development** variants clearly identify the target domain
- **Provision** variants describe the core functionality

## Decision Factors

When choosing a new name, consider:
- Does it convey the comprehensive nature of the project?
- Does it appeal to the target audience (developers setting up environments)?
- Does it differentiate from simple "scripts" or "tools"?
- Does it suggest the cross-platform capabilities?
- Is it memorable and professional?

## Implementation Notes

If a name change is decided:
- Update repository name and description
- Update all documentation and README files
- Update package names and CLI references
- Update release notes templates
- Consider domain/URL implications
