# PDS

I want to create a personal deploy script that will enable me to easily install all required tooling onto either a windows or linux vm. I'll be using bash and powershell respectively.

I'll be wanting to use package managers or either wget to fetch the urls

tooling I require

- nmap
- pycharm
- git
- az cli
- kubernetes tools

binaries installed in sys directory and added to path

various tweaks in registry for windows
